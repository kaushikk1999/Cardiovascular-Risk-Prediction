# Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients. The project uses the Framingham Heart Study dataset, which contains data on over 5,000 patients. The project first cleans and preprocesses the data, then trains a machine learning model on the data. The model is then used to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease for new patients.

The project uses a variety of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The best algorithm for this project is random forests, which achieves an accuracy of 80%.

The project also includes a web application that allows users to input their own data and get a prediction of their risk of cardiovascular disease. The web application is hosted on Heroku.

The project is open source and available on GitHub. The project is a good example of how machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed. You can then install the dependencies by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project by running the following command:

python main.py

This will start the web application on your local machine. You can then access the web application at http://localhost:5000/.

Features
This project includes the following features:

The ability to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease using machine learning.
A web application that allows users to input their own data and get a prediction of their risk of cardiovascular disease.
The ability to use a variety of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
An accuracy of 80% in predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease.
To Do
This project is still under development, and there are a few things that I would like to add in the future:

I would like to add more features to the web application, such as the ability to save predictions and the ability to compare predictions from different algorithms.
I would like to improve the accuracy of the model by using more data and by tuning the hyperparameters of the model.
I would like to deploy the model to a production environment so that it can be used by more people.
